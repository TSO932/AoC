# Advent 2019

Code for Advent of Code  -  https://adventofcode.com/2019

I've kept each solution as a single script that can be cut and pasted into an online complier.

I used https://dotnetfiddle.net/ for days 1 to 7.
On day 8, I changed to https://rextester.com/l/fsharp_online_compiler so I could make use of F# 4.0 features.
