# Advent 2019

Code for Advent of Code  -  https://adventofcode.com/2019

I've kept each solution as a single script that can be cut and pasted into an online complier.

I used https://dotnetfiddle.net/ for days 1 to 7.

On day 8, I changed to https://rextester.com/l/fsharp_online_compiler so I could make use of F# 4.0 features.

https://www.jdoodle.com/compile-fsharp-online/ is an alternative.

Day 10 Part 2 was run in VS Code to avoid timeouts.  Runing with Microsoft .NET Core SDK 3.0.100

Day 12 Part 2 took a shortcut at the end and used https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/lcm.php to calculate the lowest common multiple of the answers (one for each dimension).
